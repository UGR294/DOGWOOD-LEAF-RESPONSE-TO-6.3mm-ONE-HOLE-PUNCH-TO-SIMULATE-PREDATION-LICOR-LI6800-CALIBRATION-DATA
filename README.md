# LICOR-CALIBRATION-DATA
LICOR Research is being conducted by Undergraduate Students of North Seattle College. Our team was formed by students of the UGR program who are interested in using the LICOR 6800 LICOR Device. Our purpose was to investigate the relationship between leaf assimilation, 1st in a natural environment with a control sample, and 2nd, with a known area of leaf removed. The intention of the experiment is to determine what types of change can be seen in our LICOR data. Data shows that our control sample shows highly efficient trends in assimilation when submitted to specific intensities of light from our LICOR Device. When submitted to artificial damage in the form of a removal of a 6mm area via 1-hole punch, LICOR data shows that immediately after damage is inflicted, the measured section of leaf with a hole loses all ability to use light as a stimulant for photosynthesis.
